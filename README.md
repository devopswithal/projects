# Git Workflow Demo
## Production Branch
### Purpose
This demo is to demonstrate the general flow of work through a Git Workflow model. There will be a max of 5 branches, Production, Hotfix, Integration, Feature 1, and Feature 2. \
The first commit of each branch will be a README file, similar to this one, to describe the purpose that branch serves, and will contain any relevant documentation for the contained code. \
*Notice* \
This branch may not always be up to date with the Integration branch and features being developed.
