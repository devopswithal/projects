# Git Workflow Demo
## Production Branch
### Purpose
This is the staging branch used to merge into production. A release branch may be necessary as an intermidiate for version tagging and more controls if this branch will serve more as a development branch than staging. A Development branch could also be created from this branch, but that would increase the number and complexity of merges needed to get to production.
